# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`

 
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
I first had a story in my mind so that all the future design would have a name, the inspiration came from a book that I've read so I created this premise of a middle place between life and death. And then I started designing the classes, I didn't ask myself to finish all the design in the first try so I just design the parts and attributes and methods first, and then imagine playing the game to see if anything is missing, draw a mindmap for the overall logic, and redesign again. And when I'm 80% sure about my design, I started coding, I start to solve problem when I finish coding all the things I know, and then recode, and then debug, and just go over and over again until the end.


 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
I really enjoyed and learned a lot during the designing process, this project is definitely more complicated than all of our other ones, so need to think twice.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
Not really

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
I would make the functions of the items more interesting, each items could be used differently, and the player needs some effort or use a certain item in order to find the final one

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
I was trying to debug once an alert comes out and is marked red, but a friend suggested wait until you finished coding all the things you know and then debug, it was really useful. Because sometime they're not bugs, it's just small error due to incompletion, debugin in the very beginning is actually making it worse

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
Start early and just pull out the code to look at it everytime you have time. Because reading code sometimes requirement a small time gap in the middle to reday to debug, don't push it all together

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
